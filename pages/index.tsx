          This site is a space to explore one of the most powerful skills we can develop: being open to feedback.
          Whether you're new to the idea or already on your journey, youâ€™ll find tools, thoughts, and resources to help you grow.

          <h2>Here, youâ€™ll find:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Simple guidance on how to give and receive feedback</li>
            <li>Myths and mindset shifts that make feedback easier</li>
            <li>Free resources and reading suggestions</li>
            <li>A course to help you level up this skill</li>

          <p>
            In the spirit of being <strong>open to feedback</strong> (yes, I'm trying to live 'on brand'), Iâ€™m learning how to rebuild this site myself â€”
            using AI-powered tools and a healthy dose of curiosity. This approach is sometimes called <em>vibe coding</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            That means the site might be a little ugly, unfinished, or broken at times â€” but itâ€™s all part of the process.
            Iâ€™ll be slowly adding better design, features, and polish as I learn.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks for stopping by â€” and feel free to share your thoughts, suggestions, or feedback any time. ðŸ’¬
