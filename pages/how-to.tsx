        <h1>How to Start Being Open to Feedback</h1>
        <p>
          This is my rough 'quick start' guide, but if you're serious about developing this skillset, sign up for the course.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 1: Understand what it means to be Open to Feedback and why it's valuable</h2>
        <p>
          Listen to this podcast: <strong>How to Love Criticism</strong> from <em>WorkLife with Adam Grant</em>:

        </ul>

        <h2>Step 2: Commit personally to being more Open to Feedback</h2>
        <p>
          Write it down somewhere for yourself. Reflect on what that means.
          You could hold yourself accountable by writing "Open to Feedback" somewhere your colleagues can see — in your Slack status, email signature, or on your LinkedIn.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 3: Practice asking for and receiving feedback</h2>
        <p>
          In the future, you’ll be able to use our platform to ask for and gather feedback. For now, you could:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Start a conversation and ask for feedback</li>
          <li>Create a Google Form where people can share feedback with you</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 4: Reflect and unpack the feedback you receive, and decide what to action</h2>
        <p>
          Ask yourself: What’s not clear? What clarifying questions should I ask?
          What might be true or useful in this feedback? How can I best act on it?
        </p>

        <h3>Repeat Steps 3 and 4 on a loop!</h3>
        <p>

        <h2>When is the best time to start being open to feedback?</h2>
        <p>
          Right now! (Just kidding.) The best time to ask for feedback is when you are <strong>"above the line"</strong>.
          <br />
          Being in an "above the line" space helps reduce your natural defensive response to potentially negative feedback.
